# Local PR body checker patch

Pending [Cratis/AI#478](https://github.com/Cratis/AI/issues/478), the managed
[PR body checker](../../hooks/scripts/cratis-check-pr.mjs) has its shebang on
line one and its `cratis-ai-managed` marker on line two. The installer currently
prepends the JavaScript marker above the shebang, which causes a Node syntax error
and blocks the [Claude PR body guard](../../hooks/scripts/cratis-guard-pr-body.sh).
The Claude settings invoke five hook scripts directly, so each must keep its
execute bit: `cratis-guard-pr-body.sh`, `cratis-guard-writes.sh`,
`cratis-guard-store-mutations.sh`, `cratis-pattern-scan.sh` and
`cratis-quality-gate.sh`. The installer writes them without it
([Cratis/AI#480](https://github.com/Cratis/AI/issues/480)); preserve the bit during updates.
This is a narrowly scoped exception to the no-hand-edits rule for managed files.

The installer determines ownership from `.cratis/ai.manifest.json`, not the
marker's line number, and hashes the entire installed content. Moving the marker
therefore makes this checker a locally edited managed file. `cratis ai update
--dry-run -o json` reports `hooks/scripts/cratis-check-pr.mjs` as a conflict and
stops before applying updates. Do not change the manifest hash or use `--force`
to hide or overwrite this patch. Once the installer fix is released, review the
replacement and retire this exception through a deliberate update.

Like the other Go repositories, root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` point to the
repository-owned `rules/project.md`, rather than the installer's `general.md`.
Status and update dry-runs report these two intentional adapter overrides as
conflicts too. Preserve the project entry points; do not rewrite the manifest
or force an update that discards them.
