# Local review qualifications

- `%w` exposure is a public API decision. Do not wrap at every layer or erase
  all identities with `%v` at public boundaries; preserve documented categories,
  context cancellation and transport status contracts deliberately.
- Checking errors includes deliberate, explained suppression where safe. Do not
  change acronym/proper-name spelling solely to make an entire message lowercase.
- `samber/oops` and slog ecosystem packages are optional, not SDK dependencies to
  install by default. Standard errors, typed details and injected slog often suffice.
- Avoid global logging in library code. Redact sensitive values in both messages
  and structured fields; adding user/tenant/query attributes is not automatically safe.
- Panic recovery is a contract decision, not a blanket goroutine wrapper. Never
  silently swallow a panic or write a second HTTP status after a response starts.
- Upstream application/DB snippets illustrate errors, not architecture or Cratis
  HTTP envelopes. Missing skill cross-references are optional upstream topics;
  prefer repository-owned skills and do not install them automatically.

# Go Error Handling Best Practices

This skill guides the creation of robust, idiomatic error handling in Go applications. Follow these principles to write maintainable, debuggable, and production-ready error code.

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Returned errors MUST always be checked** — NEVER discard with `_`
2. **Errors MUST be wrapped with context** using `fmt.Errorf("{context}: %w", err)`
3. **Error strings MUST be lowercase**, without trailing punctuation
4. **Use `%w` internally, `%v` at system boundaries** to control error chain exposure
5. **MUST use `errors.Is` for sentinel matching and `errors.As`/`errors.AsType` for typed chain inspection** instead of direct comparison or bare type assertions. For Go 1.26+, prefer `errors.AsType[T](err)` when `T` implements `error`; use `errors.As(err, &target)` for Go <1.26 or for non-error interface targets.
6. **SHOULD use `errors.Join`** (Go 1.20+) to combine independent errors
7. **Errors MUST be either logged OR returned**, NEVER both (single handling rule)
8. **Use sentinel errors** for expected conditions, custom types for carrying data
9. **NEVER use `panic` for expected error conditions** — reserve for truly unrecoverable states
10. **SHOULD use `slog`** (Go 1.21+) for structured error logging — not `fmt.Println` or `log.Printf`
11. **Use `samber/oops`** for production errors needing stack traces, user/tenant context, or structured attributes
12. **Log HTTP requests** with structured middleware capturing method, path, status, and duration
13. **Use log levels** to indicate error severity
14. **Never expose technical errors to users** — translate internal errors to user-friendly messages, log technical details separately
15. **Keep log grouping low-cardinality** — at logging/APM boundaries, keep message templates stable and attach IDs, paths, line numbers, and counts as structured attributes. Error values may include useful operational context, but avoid putting high-cardinality data into the stable log message used for grouping.

## Detailed Reference

- **[Error Creation](./references/error-creation.md)** — How to create errors that tell the story: error messages should be lowercase, no punctuation, and describe what happened without prescribing action. Covers sentinel errors (one-time preallocation for performance), custom error types (for carrying rich context), and the decision table for which to use when.

- **[Error Wrapping and Inspection](./references/error-wrapping.md)** — Why `fmt.Errorf("{context}: %w", err)` beats `fmt.Errorf("{context}: %v", err)` (chains vs concatenation). How to inspect chains with `errors.Is`, `errors.As`, and Go 1.26+ `errors.AsType` for type-safe error handling, and `errors.Join` for combining independent errors.

- **[Error Handling Patterns and Logging](./references/error-handling.md)** — The single handling rule: errors are either logged OR returned, NEVER both (prevents duplicate logs cluttering aggregators). Panic/recover design, `samber/oops` for production errors, and `slog` structured logging integration for APM tools.
